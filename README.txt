You can use the following commands to compile the program:

$ fsc chess.fs pieces.fs chessApp.fsx 
$ chessApp.exe 

When you start the program you will see your available chess pieces, 
and all of the pieces avaiable moves. 
Player1 = P1 && Player2 = P2. Player1 starts the game. 

When you run the program you need to give the input arguments to the function:
E.g: b4 a3 with space and not comma. 
When player 1 has made a legal move, it becomes player 2 and so on.
